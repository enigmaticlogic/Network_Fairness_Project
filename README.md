# Network_Fairness_Project
Volunteer coding done for a network fairness research project.

Data can be obtained from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html
and http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Gplus.html

Preprocessing involved combining the fragmented network data into one large network and creating
a feature array, as well as modifying some of the files which were not in a universal format.
Also extracted the edge information from the combined network.
